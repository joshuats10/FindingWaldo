# FindingWaldo

This project is the main assignment of undergraduate coursework called 'Team-based Engineering'. 
Although the name is 'Team-based Engineering', this project is an individual project.

In this project, I created and trained my own Haar Cascade by using OpenCV on top of Python to find Waldo from 'Where's Waldo' series. I used 57 positive and 1100 negative images which I collected myself from the internet. The goal of this project is to identify Waldo from a webcam/camera input.

In order to make the cascade robust to any distortion, I created additional positive samples (double the negatives) from all the positive images by using the following command which ran automatically by the script in `commands.py`:

`opencv_createsamples -img src_img/pos/waldo{0}.png -bg bg.txt -info info/info{0}/info{0}.lst -pngoutput info -maxxangle 0.5 + -maxyangle 0.5 -num {1}`

{0} &#8594; str(num), num++

{1} &#8594; int(2*number_of_negative_images / num_pf_positive_images)

All the `info.lst` are merged to create the vector file with the following command:

`opencv_createsamples -info info/info.lst -num 2200 -w 25 -h 25 -vec positives.vec`

Finally I trained the cascade with the following command:

`opencv_traincascade -data data -vec positives.vec -bg bg.txt -numPos 2000 -numNeg 1000 -numStages 10 -w 25 -h 25`

After the cascade is trained, I try using some test images to test out the result. However,....

<strong>... the result is not satisfiable ðŸ˜¢. </strong>

Might be caused by the images collected (low resolution, number of images, etc..). Not sure, gonna look into it and try again ðŸ’ª. Might consider other tools such as TensorFlow or Keras in the future ðŸ‘€.

Note: I used OpenCV ver 3.2.0 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as the newest version removed the createsamples and traincascade features...

### Code Files and Folders Description

Folders:
* `data` - contains the trained `cascade.xml` file
* `info` - the positive images samples directory
* `result` - the result images directory
* `src_img` - location of positive and negative images as well as the test images

Files:
* `bg.txt` - text file containing the list of negative images
* `positives.vec` - the vector file containing the list of positive images description
* `commands.py` - contains script to create samples and the vector file
* `runCommands.py` - run the above file scripts'
